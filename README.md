# Deceiving Deep Neural Networks Using Generated Adversarial Input
Dissertation Project submitted in March 2019.

transfer learning.py is a generalisation script used to display the transfer learning theory in regards to the Inception V3 model.

adversarial process.py is the interesting part - a step by step process of making Inception V3 classify incorrectly... every time!
