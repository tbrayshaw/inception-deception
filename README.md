# Deceiving Deep Neural Networks Using Generated Adversarial Input
Dissertation Project

Feel free read the report to understand what's going on.

transfer learning.py is a generalisation script used to display the transfer learning theory in regards to the Inception V3 model.
adversarial process.py is the interesting part - a step by step process of making Inception V3 classify incorrectly... every time!

This project was developed using:
Python 3.7.2, pip 10.0.1, TensorFlow 1.12.0, SciPy 1.2.0, Pillow 5.4.1, matplotlib 3.0.2, numpy 1.14.5 and other dependencies that come with these versions.

The following commands should be run in the Python virtual environment terminal:

pip install tensorflow
pip install scipy
pip install pillow
pip install matplotlib

Note: TensorFlow will only work on 64-bit versions of Python
